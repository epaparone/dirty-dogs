## Summary
A sample web page based on the mockup [found here](https://github.com/Dynamit/front-end-code-day/tree/master/hotdog)

## Additional Features
Additional features I would add include: an Instagram widget to take the place of the static header photo grid using JavaScript, jQuery, and REST API framework, and additional CSS rules to create mobile-friendly iterations of the page using media queries and accompanying mockups, ideally within a mobile-first development process.
